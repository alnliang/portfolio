           Currently, I'm planning to become a software engineer. In order to
           meet the qualifications of becoming one, I have to have at least a
           bachelor's degree. Ideally, I'd like to go to Carnegie Mellon, but
           realistically, I'd like to get into UC Berkeley. After receiving a 
           degree, I plan on applying for a spot at large companies such as 
           Google. The reason why I aspire to become a software engineer is 
           simply because I find coding and engineering interesting. There are 
           so many ways you could complete a task. There are all sorts of 
           languages for all sorts of purposes. My parents also have extensive 
           backgrounds in software engineering. One works for IDT, while the 
           other works for Kyocera. Their passion for software engineering was
           passed on to me.<br><br>
           I tend to take fewer risks, unless I have a backup plan in case 
           something goes wrong. For example, whenever I'm making food, I tend 
           to follow the recipe as accurately as possible. I do this because I 
           believe that following the directions reduces the risk of failing as 
           much as possible. I also learn by watching someone else do whatever 
           I'm supposed to learn. For example, instead of reading paragraphs in
           my math textbook, I just read the examples and learn from those. In
           coding-related circumstances, the Bootstrap documentation helps 
           immensely due to the fact that they have an example of different ways
           to perform tasks as well as the differences in the results they give.
           My cautious behavior as well as the way I learn make school easier 
           for me. I also have exceptional teamwork, shown by my good relations
           with other teammates on Dublin High School's Tennis Team.<br><br>
           Achievements I've reached in high school include getting into the 
           tennis team, being recommended for English 2 Advanced, which got me 
           out of my comfort zone. I also passed summer classes in order to move
           up a level one year early, and plan to take another course of summer 
           classes this year. I am also planning on taking the AP Computer 
           Science Principles exam.<br><br>
           In conclusion, I view myself as trustworthy and easy to work with. I 
           have plenty of experience working with others. Thanks for reading, 
           and please feel free to explore the rest of my page.
