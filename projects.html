        <p>In this project, I worked on an Android application with two other students. We decided to implement a Pong game into our application. There were multiple screens on our application. There was a login screen, which had fields for both the username and password, a settings screen, which could change the color of the background, a victory screen, a defeat screen, as well as a screen to display the game itself. The Pong game itself was coded with Java, and animations were made using Java's draw function. The settings page was accessed through a three-dots menu. To win, the player must hit the ball five times, otherwise, they lose. One major difficulty my group and I had was on deciding how we were going to code a Pong game, since we were not aware of the draw function before the assignment of the project. I did the majority of the coding, while my partners did the majority of the presentation. Thus, I learned from this project about the draw function, as well as the UI of Android Studio rather thoroughly.

        <p>In this project, I worked on a seating chart with the use of Greenfoot. The project required for my picture to be interactive, able to move around, and answer questions. I decided to make my image move in a "z" shape. The questions I asked and answered were all related to topics regarding Java. This project was my first introduction to Java, so I learned many of the basics, such as how to intialize variables, class objects, and how to write methods. I've also strengthened my knowledge about 2D arrays, which is a rather advanced topic in Java. One difficulty I encountered was trying to figure out how to initialize my image onto the screen.

        <p>This project was used as a way to test our understanding of Scratch. 
          The objective of the project was to create a program that ran without 
          flaws with the use of Scratch. My partner and I decided to make a 
          platformer with gravity physics and different levels. Although simple,
          the project displays our understanding of Scratch, as gravity physics 
          are very complicated. We made sure the game ran smoothly by constantly
          debugging and testing out the code. During the project, I learned to 
          think more logically, as this project was one of my first major 
          encounters with programming. I also learned how to communicate more
          effectively, as the goal we were trying to reach wasn't easy. We also 
          constantly documented our activity in a <a href="pdfs/scratch.pdf" 
          target="_window">digital notebook</a>. We had daily logs. </p>

        <p>In this project, my partner and I used a tool called Appinventor to
          create a mobile application. We decided to create a multi-fuctional 
          application. The app had 3 functions: A timer, Calendar/Reminder, 
          and a NoteTaker. We decided to create a multi-tool because it's 
          functional and simple. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the 
          development of the application displayed our understanding of 
          Appinventor. Since each function required different elements of 
          Appinventor, we were able to utilize many of the tools provided, such 
          as TinyDB and Clocks. We had <a href="pdfs/appinventor.pdf" target="_window">
          daily logs</a> where we documented what we worked on every day during 
          the project.</p>

        <p>In this project, my partner and I used Python to create a program 
          that modifies images. Our program made collages out of the images given
          by the user, with an option for the user to add a logo on each image. 
          We decided to create a collage function since we thought it was unique.
          Since there were many elements to the collage, we needed to figure out
          how to shrink the images, and which algorithms would work best to 
          determine the width and height of the collage. During this project, my
          partner and I didn't communicate as well, since he wasn't online for 
          most of the day. In the end, it seemed like I did most of the work, so
          another skill I learned was to manage my time efficiently, since I 
          didn't have much time to work on the project, and my partner wasn't 
          helping me. As a product of this ordeal, I have learned to manage 
          others, as well. We had <a href="pdfs/pythonimg.pdf" target="_window">
          documents</a> where we wrote daily logs and showed each function and 
          its final product. </p>
