        <h5><a id="speaker"></a><strong>Influential Speakers</strong></a><br>
        <h6>AP Computer Science Applications(AP CSA)</h6><br>
        <p>During the school year, we had multiple guest speakers speak at Dublin High School. One guest speaker that stood out to me was Shawn Mehaffey, a Systems Analyst at Chevron. He is a veteran in the tech industry, for he has been working in the industry for 30 years. One thing I found very interesting about his talk was the fact that technology in the past seemed so elementary compared to what we have now. Back then, a megabyte was already considered a significantly large amount of storage. Now, people view megabytes as simply one-one thousandth of a gigabyte. Another point I found interesting was the fact that code used to be written on paper, which makes it a lot harder to preserve it. I also think it's pretty impressive that technology has changed so much, that it could significantly improve the productivitiy and efficiency of an entire company.<br><br>Another influential speaker we had was Jason Yosinski, who works at Uber AI labs. He mainly specialized in natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. One thing I though was really interesting during his talk was his demonstration of how AI recognizes objects in an image. They find and evaluate changes in color, pixels, and other changes in the image to determine what object the changes match up best to. I thought this was really interesting because of how thorough the program was. It had a setting for each type of change in color or pixels. I have a feeling that AI will change the world, either for the better or for the worse.</p>

        <h6>My Parents</h6><br>
        <p>My main mentors, as well as my primary supporters, are my parents. They both work in the industry, and have a lot of experience with technology. My father is a principle software engineer, who is mainly responsible for design and the implementation of core components in the software prodcust. My mother is a full stack web developer, who designed and developed web applications to automate workflows and improve productivity. Without the two of them, I don't think I would ever develop an interest in computer science. Even if I did, I don't I'd do very well in the field without their help. The most important things I've learned from my parents is that I have to always have a positive attitude about things, and that good effort nearly always brings good results.</p>

        <h6>Tzu Chi Foundation</h6><br>
        <h6>2018 - Present</h6>
        <p>I have been volunteering at the Tzu Chi Foundation since 2018. My experience volunteering there has proved to be very valuable. I've learned all sorts of things, such as current events, how I could help victims of natural disasters, and how to contribute to my community. Not only have I learned many things from the foundation, I've also made a couple of friends, who I would have never known, if it weren't for the foundation. Some skills that I demonstrated was my exceptional teamwork, as I got along with the others pretty well. I also had a pretty good attitude about doing work, as we eneded up working at a garden, and I took up the harder job.</p>
